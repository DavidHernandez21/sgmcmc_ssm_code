These python scripts demo fitting state space models on synthetic data.

The scripts compare different methods to learning the parameters of HMM, LGSSM, and SLDS on synthetic data.
The methods compared include SGMCMC (with and without buffering) and Gibbs sampling.

* `hmm_demo` - compares the different MCMC methods on Gaussian HMM data
* `lgssm_demo` - compares the different MCMC methods on LGSSM data
* `slds_demo` - compares the different MCMC methods on SLDS data
